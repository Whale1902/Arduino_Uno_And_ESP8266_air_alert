It was a project based on Arduino Uno clone and ESP826601 board. It was signalling by RGB LED and Piezo Buzzer when there was an Air Alarm active in my city.

After this project, I built a map of air alarms based on NodeMCU, and then another one based on Wemos D1 mini (project available [at the following link]([url](https://github.com/Whale1902/ukraine_alarm_map))).

Currently, this project is not functioning, considering that the API data source is no longer available. Therefore, I note that this project is here solely for archival purposes.
